This is an attempt to turn [Conway's Game of
Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) into a real game.

Standard Game of Life rules apply. However, there are multiple factions
(indicated by different colors). If any cell would be occipied by more than one
faction, it is empty instead.

This game features a sandbox mode as well as some custom challenges with
increasing difficulty.
